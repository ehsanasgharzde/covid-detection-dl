# COVID Detection Using Deep Learning

**Project Description:**
This project focuses on the detection of COVID-19 cases using deep learning methods. It includes a Python-based system for training and evaluating models on a custom-generated dataset. It's important to note that the dataset used in this project is randomly generated and should not be considered valid for real-world COVID-19 detection.

**Project Files:**
- **main.py**: This script serves as the main entry point for the project.
- **algorithms.py**: Contains various algorithms and functions for data processing and model evaluation.
- **modeling.py**: Includes deep learning models designed for COVID-19 detection.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python dependencies required for running this project.
- **covid-testcase.csv**: The dataset used for training and evaluating models.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the necessary Python packages. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the `main.py` script to execute the project.

**Usage:**

- The `main.py` script is responsible for managing the entire project workflow. It loads the dataset, preprocesses data, trains and evaluates models, and displays results.

- You can customize the deep learning models and algorithms located in `modeling.py` and `algorithms.py` to experiment with different approaches for COVID-19 detection.

**Disclaimer:**

The dataset used in this project is randomly generated and should not be used for actual COVID-19 detection. This project is intended solely for demonstrating deep learning techniques for classification tasks and should not be used for medical diagnosis.

Please ensure that any AI models or systems developed based on this project are used ethically and responsibly.
